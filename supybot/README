Usage
-----

1. Apply the simple patch against the source tree so that supybot will
   accept the Silc driver.

2. Put Silc.py into the drivers directory in
   Supybot-0.83.1/src/drivers.

3. Install as normal

Configuration
-------------

1. For the server, add the name of the server plus the port number,
   eg:

supybot.networks.silcnetworkname.server: silc.example.org:706

2. Note that internally, because supybot assumes all channels have a
   prefix # or !, we have to add a # in front of the name. So if you
   meant to refer to silc channel, "talk", then use the channel name
   "#talk". If you want to refer to the silc channel "#chat", then use
   "##chat". For example:

supybot.networks.silcnetworkname.channels: ##bot

3. Set the default driver to silc:

supybot.drivers.module: Silc
